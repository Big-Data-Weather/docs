The field of weather forecasting is changing.

In a market that was primarily ruled by private weather forecasting
companies, data providers are entering the field with a focused knowledge
of how to better manage and utilize enormous data sets for the publics
benefit. This expansion of the industry is opening doors for new
technology to more accurately and effectively understand weather patterns
to make future predictions more precise.

Reaction to natural disasters causes panic and grief among the public.
Proactive planning allows the public to be prepared. The poor reaction to
the 2011 Tsunami in Japan took over 15,000 lives but with more informed
forecasts, more accurate alert systems could have saved many of these
people.

Quotaero seeks to understand the differences in predicted versus actual
weather patterns by creating a simple and easy to understand system that
compares actual data from The Aerospace Corporation with weather
predictions produced by the National Center for Environmental Prediction
with the hope that this information can soon make the unknown, known.
