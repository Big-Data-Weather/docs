## Meeting Summary

### Section 1
Our sponsor showed us a demo of the data being used in Excel 2013 and one of the tools that places it on a map. He very heavily recommended we use it as one of our visualization tools, so we set it up on our server for central access. We also discussed how the information is extracted from the satellites in terms of scans and scenes. A scene is an individual data point in a scan, and a scan consists of about 9 scenes. In the past we also talked about obtaining a licensed version of Pentaho, but at this point we will most likely use the free version, Kettle. 

### Section 2
During this meeting our sponsor talked to us about the different types of databases we can use to store the data, and challenged us to explore the differences between them. We also discussed using Excel 2013 again as a visualization tool and the benefits it offers. Our sponsor really likes this product so we will most likely try to integrate it into our workflow. For the summer, we discussed how often and exactly how we would stay in contact with each other. We decided on using Incentive and updating the blog with our progress throughout the course of the summer. The main tasks we agreed upon for summer are researching the different visualization tools and practice parsing and loading the binary data into databases through IDL and Pentaho.
