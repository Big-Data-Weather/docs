## Meeting Summary

### Section 1
During this meeting, our sponsor presented us with information about GDL as well as a trial version of IDL that we will do further research on. GDL is a free, open source version of IDL that could be a potential substitute for paying the software. IDL however has a trial version that times out after 7 minutes which, if mastered, could be sufficient to use for our purposes. We then updated our sponsor on our progress using Pentaho to parse structured data. Finally, we discussed our preparations for the Pentaho course and our sponsor was both pleased and excited about our progress. 

### Section 2
In order for us to learn the tools, our sponsor suggested that we start playing with the data he has given us as soon as possible because we have almost no experience with these tools. This slightly changed our learning plan and is forcing us to learn a bit quicker than we originally planned. We also just finished registration for our 4-day online Pentaho course and discussed with our sponsor about what we would be learning from the course. The course itself takes place on Week 7 and everyone in our team will be attending it.
