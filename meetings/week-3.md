## Present at meeting

We were unable to meet with our sponsor this week due to him touring colleges with his daughter. We also thought it was not necessary to have a video chat with him because his specifications and our current tasks were clear from the previous meeting.

Bradley Cruce, Jeffrey Fellows, John Delshadi, Rebecka Goncharov, Ronnie Nguyen, Steven Ov

## Time and place

We were unable to meet with our sponsor this week due to him touring colleges with his daughter. We also thought it was not necessary to have a video chat with him because his specifications and our current tasks were clear from the previous meeting. 

## Business case changes

There were no major changes regarding the business case this week. The previous meeting provided sufficient information for the document and it will be sent to Stew for final approval by Sunday night.  

## Requirements document changes

A requirements document has been deemed to be unnecessary as no software is being created in the scope of the project. To learn more about the project, please see the business case.
