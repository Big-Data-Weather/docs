## Business case changes

+ None.

## Requirements document changes

+ We decided not to allow people to create user accounts. Instead, all simulated squirrel populations will be public. Visitors to the site will be given a randomly selected population to manipulate. They can play with it for as long as they like, but when they close their browser window they will lose the population. If all populations are currently "assigned", the system will create a new population. As a result, there are no public or private populations; all populations are public.

## Project development and delivery timeline

+ We will deliver the simulation "core" first, by the end of Week 7. We will show Kayla and Jeff weekly progress starting in Week 5.
+ We will build a simple interactive interface for the simulation in Weeks 8 and 9.
+ We will add the functionality that randomly assigns a population (or makes a new one) to a visiting user in Week 10.
