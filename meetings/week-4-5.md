## Meeting Summary

### Section 1
During these meetings, our sponsor explained in further detail some of the tools we might be using for the project. Our Sponsor deemed several new tools necessary to learn for the project and we discussed methods of acquiring and learning these tools. Other than the addition of new possible tools (Wolfram Alpha and IDL) nothing else has changed regarding our project.

### Section 2
In order for us to learn the tools, our sponsor suggested that we start playing with the data we have as soon as possible because we have almost no experience with these tools. This slightly changed our learning plan and is forcing us to learn a bit quicker than we originally planned. We also just finished registration for our 4-day online Pentaho course and discussed with our sponsor about what we would be learning from the course. The course itself takes place on Week 7 and everyone in our team will be attending it.
