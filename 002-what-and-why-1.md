## What we are building
We are building and researching different pattern macros for future weather research done by the sponsor. We will be trying out a combination of visualization tools, big data tools, and processes to see which ones work best for different types of data and needs. In the end we will have documentation detailing the best macros, when to use them, and how to use them.

## Why we are building it
We are working on this project because our stakeholder needs a good understanding of the combinations of tools that can be used to optimize and explore large amounts of weather data. The problem that the sponsor had was that they have been obtaining their data by manually programming a tool to obtain certain data results and it was getting expensive. But now with so many advanced tools out there they can now easily generate the information they need. The problem is figuring out which tools to optimally combine to get the intended result. Each different user that will use our research will have a better understanding of what tools to use for the result they are trying to get.
