## What we are building
We are building and researching different pattern macros critical future weather research by the public and military sector by using big data tools in sync with visualization tools. In the end we will have a large quantity of documentation for research professions in the public and military sector to help them further their research progress.
## Why we are building it
The Big Weather Data project addresses the needs for our stakeholder, because they need a good understanding of the combinations of tool that can be used to optimize and explore large amounts of weather data. The problem that the public and military sector have is that they have been obtaining their data by manually programming to obtain certain data results. But now with so many advanced tools out there they can now generating massive amount of macros and generate the results they need. Since there are so many tool they need to figure out which tools to optimally combine to achieve the intended result. Each different user that will use our research will have a better understanding of what tools to use for the result they are trying to obtain.
