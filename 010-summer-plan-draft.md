# Assessment 

At the end of this quarter we delivered to our sponsor an in progress workflow of the process for extracting, loading and transforming weather data and two simple visualizations. 

Our sponsor was very pleased with the items we delivered to him. He mentioned how this begins the next stage in our project and briefly touched upon what we will need to do in the Summer and Fall.

Since the objective of our project has changed, we will be gathering what will be needed for the next stage.

To deliver the final project we must learn Javascript and familiarize ourselves with the API of NullSchool. We will also need to continue researching visualization tools.

As mentioned, our project has changed and we’ve only had a brief time to discuss what must be done. We will be meeting with our sponsor in the near future to elicit the future requirements.

To make the most progress, we must first learn Javascript since our project will be heavily dependant on it. We will be having tutorials and creating small projects to give us experience.

The skill needed to do this work is Javascript

Jeffrey, Ronnie and Steven have a slight background in Javascript programming. Bradley, Rebecka and John have not yet been exposed to Javascript.

The members in our team who are not acclimated with Javascript can attain these skills by using online tutorials, constructing mock projects and using the resources provided by Professor Ziv.
