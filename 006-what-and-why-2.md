## What we are building

We are building and researching different pattern transformations for future weather research done by the sponsor. We will be trying out a combination of visualization tools, big data tools, and processes to see which ones work best for different types of data and needs. In the end, we will have documentation detailing the best transformations, when to use them, and how to use them.

## Why we are building it

We are working on this project because our stakeholder needs a better understanding of the combinations of tools that can be used to optimize and explore large amounts of previously gathered weather data. The problem that the sponsor has is that they have been obtaining their data by manually programming a tool to obtain certain data results, resulting in high costs, but now with so many advanced tools, both open source and enterprise, they can now easily generate the information they need. The problem is figuring out which tools to optimally combine to get the intended result. Each different user that will use our research will have a better understanding of what tools to use for the result they are trying to achieve. Our sponsor has also expressed that it is his interest that another big part of the project is that we learn along the way. 

##Quarter Breakdown

###Spring
During Spring quarter our main task will be setting up the environments we will be using throughout the year and to become familiar with data extraction and transformation using the various tools. This will mainly be considered research time to prepare for the bulk of the work that comes in the Fall quarter. Finally, we should be able to conduct practice transformations using data from NOAA weather satellites.

###Fall
Fall quarter consists of running the sponsor provided “blob” data through our previously mentioned transformations to produce the different desired visualizations. We will also continue to research new tools to visualize the data. 

###Winter
The Winter quarter will be a wrap up of the tools we used in producing the different visualizations. We will provide our sponsor with a report on the different types of tools along with their individual benefits, drawbacks, easy of use, and overall user support.
