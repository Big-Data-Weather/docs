## Incomplete 
+ None

## Notes
+ GDL seems to be too much of a hassle to install, also only runs on Mac and Linux, we will attempt to use the trial version of IDL to parse the binary. If that fails, we will attempt GDL once more.
+ We will now attempt to set up the server at a friendâ€™s house. More security, can remote desktop, no need to email and get permissions.
