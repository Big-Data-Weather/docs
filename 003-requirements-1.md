##INSTRUCTIONS##
The file should have three sections. The first section should be called “Assumptions.” The second should be called “Functional requirements.” The third should be called “Non-functional requirements.” The document should be no more than 1000 words. Write your “assumptions” section last. The document will be graded on how comprehensively and clearly it specifies what your system must do.

## Assumptions

## Functional requirements

+Macros should be made that can extract information from large sets of data
+Macros should be made to filter the data according to specific weather attributes
+Macros should be made to transform the data extracted from the data set
+The processes to generate different types of visualizations of the data should be documented.

## Non-functional requirements

+The tools used should cost as little as possible.
