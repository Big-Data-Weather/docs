We will use Git and GitHub for file management.

Specifically, we will keep all files in GitHub repositories owned by our organization, "sqrly".

We will keep documentation in the "docs" repository.

We will keep code in two repositories, "anatomy" and "behavior". We will keep code about the squirrel's anatomy in the "anatomy" repository, and code about its behavior in the "behavior" repository.

## Miscellaneous

We agree to communicate regularly, even if the news is bad.

Every person commits to attending scheduled meetings and co-working hours.

We will tell our teammates as early as we can if we can't make a meeting or work session.

We agree to volunteer to take on tasks and do them well and on time as best we can.

If we don't know how to do something, we will do our best to figure it out. We will ask for help if we get stuck.
