Things to include for ours in particular:
Tools and what we need to know how to use about those tools
how do the tools relate to one another
how comfortable we are with the tools
how we are going to learn these tools

In your team’s docs repository, make a file called 005-skills.md. The file should have two parts. In the first, list the skills you will need for the whole project. Focus on technical skills; skip things like “we will need to know how to do user testing.” Include things like “we will need to know how to code HTML and CSS,” “we will need to know how to use the Laravel framework and program in PHP” and “we will need to know how to set up a MySQL database.”

##Skills needed for whole project (technical only):

##Individual Assessment

     1. What is your name? Bradley Cruce
     2. In general, how well can you code? Pick one of “real good,” “pretty good,” “okay,” or “not at all.”
     3. How many times before have you used the language(s) and/or framework(s) you are using in this project? For each language or framework, pick one of “lots and lots,” “a couple times,” “once,” “never,” or “I never even heard of this thing.”
     4. To contribute fully to the project, what do you need to learn?
     5. In the next two weeks (weeks 4 and 5), how many hours will you spend learning what you need to learn to be able to contribute fully to the project?
     6. What times have you allocated on your calendar for this learning?
     7. Where will you be at those times?
     8. How will you learn what you need to learn? Be as specific as possible. “I will work through Chapters 1–5 of Hello, Android” is much better than “I will do some tutorials about Android programming.”

          Pretty good.

     Pentaho: Never
     4. To contribute fully to the project, what do you need to learn?
     How to use Pentaho and where to be able to research different visualization tools. I will also need to learn the syntax for the different database tools that we will be using. 
     5. In the next two weeks (weeks 4 and 5), how many hours will you spend learning what you need to learn to be able to contribute fully to the project?
     I will dedicate five hours to learning how to use Pentaho since my current job uses a tool very similar to it. The database tools will take more time, but I plan on learning them as they’re needed throughout the entire project course.
     6. What times have you allocated on your calendar for this learning?
     After our meeting times on Wednesdays around 8pm.
     7. Where will you be at those times?
     The location does not matter. I will be using my laptop to research and perform these tasks.
     8. How will you learn what you need to learn? Be as specific as possible. “I will work through Chapters 1–5 of Hello, Android” is much better than “I will do some tutorials about Android programming.”
     I will use data provided by publicly accessible sources such as wunderground.com to work through the tools in Pentaho to perform different trasnformations. This will essentially be a mini version of the overall project, which will give me the skills needed to perform the overall task.
     9. How will you communicate your learning to your team?
     By offering my assistance to other when questions are posed. I will also update our Wiki on Incentive to have easily accessible information on the various tasks.
