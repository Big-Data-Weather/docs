##Tools/Skills needed for whole project (technical only):
+We will need to know how to use Pentaho to integrate big data and evaluate the statistics and analytics of such data. 
+We must learn how to create workflows in Pentaho using visual tools. 
+We will need to use MongoDB and Hadoop to create list based data structures based on the big data. 
+Mathematica and any other information visualization tools must also be learned to create visuals based on data.

##Individual Assessment

     1. What is your name? 
          Bradley Cruce
     2. In general, how well can you code? 
          Okay
     3. How many times before have you used tools you are using in this project? 
          Pentaho: Never, MongoDB: Never, Hadoop: Never, Mathematica: Once
     4. To contribute fully to the project, what do you need to learn?
          I need to learn mostly Pentaho and MongoDB as well as finding new and exciting visualization tools to aid in the second half of our project. Finally, learning Hadoop may be the hardest part for me because I’m not familiar with its use or with its function. 
     5. In the next two weeks (weeks 4 and 5), how many hours will you spend learning what you need to learn to be able to contribute fully to the project?
          I’ve already spent roughly 2-3 hours setting up Pentaho and trying to download test data to analyze. I am dedicating 6 hours over week 4 and 4 hours over week 5 to try to better understand Pentaho and to set up MongoDB.
     6. What times have you allocated on your calendar for this learning?
          I have allocated 2 hours Sunday April 20th from 6-8pm, 3 hours Monday April 21st from 7-10pm, 1 hour Friday April 25th from 7-8pm, and 4 hours on Saturday April 26th from 2-6pm in order to learn these tasks. 
     7. Where will you be at those times?
          The majority of the time I will be in a study room in the Camino del Sol housing complex however for the Monday and Friday times I will be at the Newport Beach City Library. 
     8. How will you learn what you need to learn? 
          The following Youtube channels have fairly extensive and highly rated video tutorials for Pentaho: bfair, Intellipaat Software Solutions, and ETLTools
     9. How will you communicate your learning to your team?
          I will communicate with my team by demonstrating what I have learned at team meetings and also by sending the test data that I have processed through Pentaho. I would also like to spend some time documenting my processes for data integration because I think the process will be intensive and not easily replicable especially for a group unfamiliar with the language of these systems. 

     1. What is your name? 
          Rebecka Goncharov
     2. In general, how well can you code? 
          Okay
     3. How many times before have you used the tools you are using in this project? 
          Pentaho: Never, MongoDB: Never, Hadoop: A couple times, Mathematica: Once
     4. To contribute fully to the project, what do you need to learn?
          The primary focus for me will be to understand the tools and their specific uses. The most important task is to understand how to integrate big data, how to create workflows using Pentaho, how to create database structures using MongoDB and Hadoop and ultimately the visualization Mathematica provides. 
     5. In the next two weeks (weeks 4 and 5), how many hours will you spend learning what you need to learn to be able to contribute fully to the project?
          I will spend about 8-10 hours during weeks 4 and 5 to completely learn the tool.
     6. What times have you allocated on your calendar for this learning?
          I do not have school Monday and Friday therefore I will be working on learning the tools for about 4 hours on those days individually. We have also allocated Wednesday meetings for 2 hours where we will ask for clarification, help one another and review what we have learned.
     7. Where will you be at those times?
          I will be at my favorite coffee shop in Laguna Beach, at the school library or the designated ICS lab.
     8. How will you learn what you need to learn? Be as specific as possible. “I will work through Chapters 1–5 of Hello, Android” is much better than “I will do some tutorials about Android programming.”
          I have found a shortened PDF for “Hadoop for Dummies” which I will read in order to understand Hadoop. A few team members found various tutorials and wiki’s for the other tools such as: http://wiki.pentaho.com/display/EAI/Pentaho+Data+Integration+(Kettle)+Tutorial http://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb/. Our sponsor has also provided us a NOAA website to use to practice integrating big data. 
     9. How will you communicate your learning to your team?
          I will communicate my learning by explaining what I know during our team meetings as well as show them my work and created visualizations through Google docs and Trello.

     8. How will you learn what you need to learn? Be as specific as possible. “I will work through Chapters 1–5 of Hello, Android” is much better than “I will do some tutorials about Android programming.”
          I will follow the tutories that John provided in his section.
     9. How will you communicate your learning to your team?
          I will offer my services to my teammates when we are working together.

     1. What is your name? 
          Ronnie Nguyen
     2. In general, how well can you code? Pick one of “real good,” “pretty good,” “okay,” or “not at all.”
          Okay
     3. How many times before have you used tools you are using in this project? For each tool, pick one of “lots and lots,” “a couple times,” “once,” “never,” or “I never even heard of this thing.”
          Pentaho: Never, MongoDB: Never, Hadoop: Never , Mathematica: Never
     4. To contribute fully to the project, what do you need to learn?
          One of the main things I will need to learn is how to use Pentaho to integrate big data and evaluate the statics and analytics of such data. Once that is learned, I must learn how to create workflows in Pentaho using visual tools. Then I must learn how to use MongoDB and Hadoop to create list based data structures based on the big data. Mathematica and any other information visualization tools must also be learened to create visuals based on data. 
     5. In the next two weeks (weeks 4 and 5), how many hours will you spend learning what you need to learn to be able to contribute fully to the project?
          Hopefully 3-4 hours a week at least.
     6. What times have you allocated on your calendar for this learning?
          Every night from 8pm - 12am i put time aside for work and studying which where I learn these tools I need to know. Additionally, during our team meetings, if we find it necessary, we will go over the tools together to help each other learn. 
     7. Where will you be at those times?
          Most of the time, I will be in my apartment at those times, but the location itself is irrelevant.
     8. How will you learn what you need to learn? Be as specific as possible. “I will work through Chapters 1–5 of Hello, Android” is much better than “I will do some tutorials about Android programming.”
          Our sponsor gave us the source of some big data from the NOAA weather site for the team to practice with. I will do my best to get comfortable using the tools with that practice data. Additionally, one of my team members provided us with several good pdf’s, one for example is “Hadoop for Dummies.” If i get the chance I will look for relevant topics in these pdf’s or on Youtube.com to become as familiar with these tools as possible. I was also hoping to start a folder in our team’s Google Drive on learning resources/tutorials that we either find or create specifically for the project just to show that we are capable of using the tools. 
     9. How will you communicate your learning to your team?
          While playing with the practice data, I will save my work to show them what I am capable of doing with the tools. Also, if time permits, I will write/add my own tutorials on tasks we should know how to do in the team’s Google Drive.

     1. What is your name?
          Jeffrey Fellows
     2. In general, how well can you code? Pick one of “real good,” “pretty good,” “okay,” or “not at all.” 
          Pretty good.
     3. How many times before have you used tools you are using in this project? For each tool, pick one of “lots and lots,” “a couple times,” “once,” “never,” or “I never even heard of this thing.”
          Pentaho, Hadoop, Mathematica, MongoDB: Never
     4. To contribute fully to the project, what do you need to learn?
          How to use Pentaho and where to be able to research different visualization tools. I will also need to learn the syntax for the different database tools that we will be using, but those can be learned throughout the project as they’re needed. 
     5. In the next two weeks (weeks 4 and 5), how many hours will you spend learning what you need to learn to be able to contribute fully to the project?
          I will dedicate five hours to learning how to use Pentaho since my current job uses a tool very similar to it. The database tools will take more time, but I plan on learning them as they’re needed throughout the entire project course.
     6. What times have you allocated on your calendar for this learning?
          After our meeting times on Wednesdays around 8pm.
     7. Where will you be at those times?
          The location does not matter. I will be using my laptop to research and perform these tasks.
     8. How will you learn what you need to learn? Be as specific as possible. “I will work through Chapters 1–5 of Hello, Android” is much better than “I will do some tutorials about Android programming.”
          I will use data provided by publicly accessible sources such as wunderground.com to work through the tools in Pentaho to perform different trasnformations. This will essentially be a mini version of the overall project, which will give me the skills needed to perform the overall task.
     9. How will you communicate your learning to your team?
          By offering my assistance to other when questions are posed. I will also update our Wiki on Incentive to have easily accessible information on the various tasks.
